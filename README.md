# 📖  Space Travelers' Hub <a name="about-project"></a>

In this project, we will leverage real-time data from the SpaceX API to develop a web application. The focus of this application is to create a platform for a company specializing in both commercial and scientific space travel services. Within this web application, users will have the capability to reserve rockets and participate in specific space missions


## 🛠 Built With <a name="built-with"></a>

>The project is built using the following technologies and tools:

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- React
- Redux

<!-- Features -->

### Key Features <a name="key-features"></a>

> The main features of the application include:

- Rocket Reservation: Users can browse and select from a list of available rockets and make reservations for future space travel.

- Mission Selection: Users can explore and choose from a variety of space missions, each with its own objectives and destinations.

- User Profiles: Registered users can create and manage profiles, including personal information, travel history, and preferences.

- Booking Management: Users can view, modify, or cancel their rocket reservations and mission participation.

- Real-time SpaceX Data: The application fetches real-time data from the SpaceX API to provide up-to-date information about rockets, missions, and space-related events.
